## Log

### R2D1 

January 1

Why not start over for the new year? Today's goal is to make progress on my FreeCodeCamp responsive web design certificate. I've finished a few projects but am currently working on the landing page. We'll see how far I get today.

### R2D2

January 2

I spent a while trying to get the navigation bra to look how I wanted and pick out fonts. I'm not too great at picking fonts. I also read a few Javascript related tutorials.

###R2D3

January 3

I made my nav bar fixed and now it's broken. I had it looking good using Flexbox but when I added position: fixed to it everything got messed up. Taking a break and looking at it again tomorrow.

###R2D4

January 4

Today I'm working more on my landing page. I need to figure out what happened to my nav bar. I might start from scratch and see what happens.
