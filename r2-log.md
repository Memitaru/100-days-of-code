 #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 2 - Amanda Thomas

The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on [January 1, 2019].

## Log

### R2D1 

January 1

Why not start over for the new year? Today's goal is to make progress on my FreeCodeCamp responsive web design certificate. I've finished a few projects but am currently working on the landing page. We'll see how far I get today.

### R2D2

January 2

I spent a while trying to get the navigation bra to look how I wanted and pick out fonts. I'm not too great at picking fonts. I also read a few Javascript related tutorials.

###R2D3

January 3

I made my nav bar fixed and now it's broken. I had it looking good using Flexbox but when I added position: fixed to it everything got messed up. Taking a break and looking at it again tomorrow.

###R2D4

January 4

Today I'm working more on my landing page. I need to figure out what happened to my nav bar. I might start from scratch and see what happens.

###R2D5

January 5

I fixed my landing page. It was a little bit of a hassle and it's not as responsive as I'd like but here it is.

I've been using GitHub pages for them which makes it easy to share live versions of all of my practice projects.

###R2D6

January 6

Started work on my Tech Documentation website for the freecodecamp certification. Started by copy-pasting the info and then adding HTML to it. Stuff like sections, divs, h2s... Plan to work on styling tomorrow.

###R2D7

January 7

Styling this wasn't too difficult. The only thing that took time was getting the sidebar to have a scrollbar but it only took a few minutes of research to find out how. I also created a class that would make my code a monospace font and give a darker backgrond which I think looked good.

Overall this project was pretty easy. The most time consuming part was adding the HTML to the documentation since there was so much.

This is also when I started working on preprocessing over at Lambda School! Learned the basics of less.

###R2D8

January 8

Today was all about the survey page for freecodecamp. This one was pretty easy since I had a lot of practice with forms. Mostly I took my time styling it so it would look nice and messing with gender options since that's something important to me.

Finished my first project in LESS. Mock resume.

###R2D9

January 9

Moving on to my portfolio page. I saw a few people's and I really liked the idea of the background image that was the full vewport and the top and then you could scroll to the rest of the content so I went with that.

Learned more LESS in class.

###R2D10

January 10

My portfolio page is mostly done. At this point I'm tweaking it to look good on mobile.

My LESS project is done and I really love LESS!!

###R2D12

Jaunary 12

Today was my big LESS sprint challenge. 3 hours to complete a project using everything I learned the last two weeks.

It went really well. I finished 3 out of the 4 stretch goals. I skipped the forms because I've done them a lot.

I think I got it looking really good on mobile. My stretch goals were the fixed navigation bar that I learned in my landing page, the blog page using flexbox to make mobile look better, and the CSS animations.
